A major part of this assignment was to "isolate repeated
tasks into methods".  All three of your letters have the
exact same text, but you put it into your program three
separate times, and didn't make any attempt to use methods
to consolidate all that repetition.  In that way, even
though you did write a program that prints letters, you didn't
really accomplish the assignment.  You did do the proper method
calls in your main() method, so I will give you 8 points out of
15 for the main score.

For future projects, you will want to start using comments to
show the structure of your code.
